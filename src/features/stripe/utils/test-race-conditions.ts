 * Testing utilities for Stripe webhook race conditions

 * 1. Add artificial delays to webhook handlers during testing

 * 3. Monitor console logs for race condition prevention

/**
 * Testing scenarios you can run:
 * 
 * 1. RACE CONDITION SIMULATION:
 *    - Replace handlers in webhook route with the *WithDelay versions
 *    - Use Stripe CLI to trigger multiple events quickly:
 *      stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
 *      stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated (immediately after)
 * 
 * 2. OUT-OF-ORDER EVENTS:
 *    - Create a test clock in Stripe Dashboard
 *    - Advance time and trigger events in different orders
 *    - Watch console logs to see which events are processed vs skipped
 * 
 * 3. DUPLICATE EVENTS:
 *    - Use Stripe CLI to send the same event multiple times:
 *      stripe events resend evt_xxx
 *    - Verify that only the first occurrence updates the database
 * 
 * 4. MONITORING IN PRODUCTION:
 *    - Keep the console.log statements in your production code
 *    - Monitor your application logs for "RACE CONDITION PREVENTED" messages
 *    - Set up alerts if you see frequent race condition prevention (might indicate issues)
 */

/**
 * Example test sequence:
 * 
 * 1. Start your development server with logging enabled
 * 2. Use Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe`
 * 3. In another terminal, trigger events:
 *    ```
 *    stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
 *    sleep 0.5  # Wait half a second
 *    stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated
 *    ```
 * 4. Watch your console logs for race condition detection
 * 5. Check your database to verify correct final state
